# AI-Agent-for-Stock-Selection
The project aimed to develop a robust investment decision-making framework integrating Agentic AI. It covers the creation of agents that assess client risk profiles, generate tailored strategies, and perform backtesting using S&P 500 data. The system incorporates LLM models like GPT-4, leveraging libraries such as Langchain, to engage clients, assess risk, and optimize strategies. Key challenges include integrating agent components, improving strategy performance, and refining the backtesting workflow.

Backtesting_single_strategy shows the strategy and backtesting process.
